# Your Project Name

Description of your project goes here.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Usage

After you have installed the dependencies, set up the database configuration. Here, I am using MongoDB and Mongoose as the ODM. I am not using a .env file to simplify the configuration. Next, run the "back" folder first. This is because the port setting I use is 3000. After that, please run the "front" folder. Simply type the command "npm run node". Congratulations, you have successfully run the web application that I have created.
